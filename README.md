MemeMe version 2.0
Created by Victor Asselta

Despite the name this is verion 2 of the MemeMe application.
This version is for the 3rd assignment, second and final for the MemeMe application.

This version adds quite a bit of functionality to the original. 
Two collection views, table and grid layout, have been added to display sent memes or a placeholder if none exists.
These collection views can be accessed via custom icons in the bottom tab bar.
You can add or view details of these memes from the two collection views.
You can edit memes from the detail view and then share them via the editor.

Several bugs have also been addressed.
